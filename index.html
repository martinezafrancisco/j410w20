    <div class="text">On Saturday, Feb. 8, SLO Smash Community members gathered in Engineering IV (Bldg. 192) to compete in the third edition of Ultimate Polytown Slo-down, known within the community as UPS. The competition began with a doubles tournament, which saw teams of two duke it out against each other to be crowned the top pairing.

In total, 13 teams participated in Saturday's tournament. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

    <div class="text">Economics junior and SLO Smash Community Treasurer James Hasbany said attendance at tournaments has increased over the last few years because of the popularity of the Nintendo Switch, which has the latest edition of the Super Smash Bros. video game, compared to the Nintendo Wii U. 

    "The Wii U was the kind of console that your friend had but nobody else had," Hasbany said.

    The Nintendo Switch has sold 52.48 million units worldwide as of Dec. 31, 2019, compared to the Wii U's 13.56 million units sold, according to Nintendo financial data. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

    <div class="text">Some pairs, however, have been showing up for a while. For political science senior Mateen Nozzari and philosophy senior Bryce Myers, this was not their first tournament as a duo, but they have not won a tournament either. Myers, however, said he's "come close" in the past as he's "tried to get better in college." Myers said he began playing the Smash Bros. series around 2005. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

    <div class="text">Nozzari fumbled through his backpack to untangle his Nintendo Switch Pro Controller cords. Switch controllers are one of two types of controllers used in the competitive Super Smash Bros. scene, along with old-school Nintendo GameCube controllers. 

Usage of controllers depends on when a player began playing Smash Bros., according to mechanical engineering senior and club member Jared Palmer. Those who have played longer will often use GameCube controllers, Palmer said, while newer players use the Switch Pro Controller.

"I know that it feels very natural and you can really get those nutty little inputs," Nozzari said. "You can get kind of saucy with it." (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

    <div class="text">After moments of preparation with practice rounds across the tournament venue, Nozzari and Myers are paired up for their first match of the tournament. Their opponents are Nick Plewtong and Andres Hernandez, both of whom are Cal Poly alumni.

All four players joked about the high probability of "cheese" during their match. Cheese is considered to be an unorthodox strategy and "abusing some of the mechanics," according to Plewtong. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

    <div class="text">Almost immediately into the first game of the three-game match, Nozzari, Myers and their opponents were caught off-guard after Myers saved his character from losing a life. It was pure cheese.

The first game ended in favor of the Nozzari-Myers duo, but their opponents came back to win the match 2-1. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

Both pairs were rapidly inputting button commands on their controllers to counter their opponent's attacks and land some damage of their own.  (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

Nozarri, staring at the television screen displaying final results, and Myers lost their second match and were eliminated from the tournament, as a result. Myers and Nozzari lost their final match-up by a score of 2-0. (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)

"We will be back," Nozzari said. "Let 'em know." (Feb. 8, 2020 | San Luis Obispo, Calif.)
